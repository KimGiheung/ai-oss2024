00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:01.418
Ever seen in politics.

00:00:01.418 --> 00:00:03.211
Three American presidents

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:05.005
together in New York City

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.215
in a sign of party unity.

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:08.299
But much of their focus

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:09.092
and attacks

00:00:09.092 --> 00:00:10.719
were about the other guy

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.345
from the other party

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.682
who also held the Oval Office.

00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:18.768
We've got three presidents tonight,

00:00:18.977 --> 00:00:20.687
a presidential trifecta

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:22.147
at Radio City Music

00:00:22.147 --> 00:00:23.231
Hall, Joe

00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:24.190
Biden and listing

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.191
former Presidents

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.359
Obama and Clinton

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.695
for a historic fundraiser

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.572
that was closed to video cameras

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:34.993
except for the campaigns that

00:00:35.076 --> 00:00:38.079
Biden raising more than $25 million,

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:40.415
adding to his growing war chest,

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.667
which far outpaces Trump's.

00:00:42.667 --> 00:00:45.295
But money is not Biden's only weapon.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:46.004
The president

00:00:46.004 --> 00:00:48.339
sharpening his personal attacks,

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:49.716
going after Trump

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.469
the way Trump belittles his opponents.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.595
I'd be happy to play.

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:54.888
I told him once before.

00:00:54.888 --> 00:00:56.556
I said, I'll give you three strokes

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.349
if you carry your own bag.

00:00:58.349 --> 00:01:00.435
And it got tougher from there.

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:01.936
Little old and out-of-shape

00:01:01.936 --> 00:01:02.854
Biden staffer

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:04.689
is now calling Trump feeble,

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.524
confused and weak.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:08.985
But as we learned in 2016,

00:01:08.985 --> 00:01:10.320
beating Trump at his own

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.988
game is not easy.

00:01:11.988 --> 00:01:13.740
Have you seen his hands?

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.867
They're like this.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.951
And you know what they say

00:01:16.951 --> 00:01:18.620
about men with small hands.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.996
You can't trust them.

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.457
He referred to my hands if they're small.

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.125
Something else must be small.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.587
I guarantee you there's no problem.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.130
I was there that night.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.382
It really happened here with me today.

00:01:31.382 --> 00:01:32.467
Podcast host

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:33.927
and author of the bestseller

00:01:33.927 --> 00:01:34.594
Burn Book,

00:01:34.594 --> 00:01:36.471
Kara Swisher, editor

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:37.806
in chief of The Dispatch

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.599
and columnist at the L.A. Times.

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:41.101
Jonah Goldberg,

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:41.476
New York

00:01:41.476 --> 00:01:42.185
Times, journalist

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:45.188
and podcast host Lulu GARCIA-NAVARRO,

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.315
and editor in chief of the Washington

00:01:47.315 --> 00:01:49.484
Free Beacon, Eliana Johnson.

00:01:49.484 --> 00:01:51.277
Welcome back, everyone.

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.237
Good to have you here.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:55.406
Kara, when it comes to personal

00:01:55.406 --> 00:01:57.117
insults and trolling,

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.619
can Biden out Trump?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.745
Trump Oh, yes.

00:02:00.745 --> 00:02:02.664
Oh, Trump. Trump. He has to be Biden.

00:02:02.664 --> 00:02:04.290
I think he's actually quite good at it.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.167
He was good at the last election cycle.

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.461
The come on man, the thing that he does.

00:02:08.461 --> 00:02:09.337
So I think he's just got to

00:02:09.337 --> 00:02:11.172
be genuine to himself when he's doing it.

00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.590
And that was that was a good dig.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.384
And this is where politics is with Trump.

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.386
You have to sort of meet him there.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.429
And Trump could be rather thin skinned

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.515
when it happens and maybe he'll hit back.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:22.016
But I think Biden's pretty good

00:02:22.016 --> 00:02:23.476
at it, actually, Eliana.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:26.396
Biden's staffers are reportedly

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.522
test marketing

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.859
various insults like broke down

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.402
and low energy,

00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:33.611
Don, both of which

00:02:33.611 --> 00:02:35.196
I think are kind of weak.

00:02:35.196 --> 00:02:36.072
And the question I have,

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:37.490
what do we think of the chances

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.241
that Biden,

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:39.284
our staff,

00:02:39.284 --> 00:02:41.828
can come up with a killer nickname

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:43.663
like Crooked Hillary?

00:02:43.663 --> 00:02:46.040
And should he even try?

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.668
I don't think it's a good idea.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.170
Look,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.922
Trump has shown that nobody can outdo him

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:53.506
at this game,

00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:55.383
but you can tell that the Biden

00:02:55.383 --> 00:02:56.634
team, Biden,

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:58.094
feels the need to keep

00:02:58.094 --> 00:03:00.346
the attention on Trump.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:01.806
And they know that to the extent

00:03:01.806 --> 00:03:04.392
Trump is dominating the headlines,

00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.186
they can keep the attention on him

00:03:06.186 --> 00:03:07.437
and not talk about the Biden

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:08.646
administration's record.

00:03:08.646 --> 00:03:11.399
That is good for him. I'm sorry, though.

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:12.066
Calling him

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:15.195
old and feeble is not going to make up

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.488
for the fact that their own guy is

00:03:17.488 --> 00:03:20.408
old and feeble.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:22.243
I think social media,

00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:22.535
we live

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:24.162
in a social media age and I think,

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:24.370
you know,

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:25.830
there's things like Don Corleone

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.165
that's actually a pretty good one.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:29.125
But that wasn't the Biden people.

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:31.336
Their social media is excellent debate.

00:03:31.336 --> 00:03:32.337
The Biden team,

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.129
whoever's running

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.756
it is really smart and does

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:36.674
focuses a lot on the policy.

00:03:36.674 --> 00:03:38.259
And so I think you have to operate

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.968
in these zones.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:40.470
No matter how you slice it,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.221
because the press pays

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.430
attention, other politicians

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.264
pay attention,

00:03:43.264 --> 00:03:45.141
and it creates names that move along.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:46.726
So I agree with you

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:47.435
that he shouldn't

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:48.436
try to out Trump Trump

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:51.439
and that going after Trump in a way

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.940
is good

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:52.857
fan service

00:03:52.857 --> 00:03:53.608
or his own base,

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:54.192
and he needs to show

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:55.735
that he's fighting is up.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:56.569
But I agree with Eliana

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:57.695
that specifically

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:00.073
the terms old and feeble.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:01.241
If it's a debate about

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.659
who's older and feeble,

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:04.535
I don't think those are on Biden's turf.

00:04:04.535 --> 00:04:05.578
That's not Biden's turf.

00:04:05.578 --> 00:04:06.996
Although if he shows himself

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:07.664
to be vibrant,

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.831
which he did at this event,

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:10.250
he's shown it to be at that's

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.834
at the State of the Union address.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.044
Then it becomes interesting.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:14.170
Why not shove it back?

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.214
I think he has to show that

00:04:16.214 --> 00:04:17.173
he's out there,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:18.925
that he's vigorous and unfortunately,

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:21.010
we are in the I'm

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.178
rubber and you're a glue

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:23.805
and whatever I say sticks back to you.

00:04:23.805 --> 00:04:25.723
I mean, that's kind of where we're at now

00:04:25.723 --> 00:04:26.683
in terms of these two men.

00:04:26.683 --> 00:04:28.226
They're both old.

00:04:28.226 --> 00:04:30.019
And so I'm pointing each other

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:30.770
fingers at each other

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.813
is just what we're seeing.

00:04:31.813 --> 00:04:32.146
Let me

00:04:32.146 --> 00:04:34.274
let me pick up on another aspect of this,

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:36.025
which was that fund raiser.

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:38.069
Is it smart?

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:38.319
Is it

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.487
effective politics

00:04:39.487 --> 00:04:43.366
for Biden to enlist Obama and to enlist

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:43.825
Clinton?

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:48.079
And specifically, can they help him

00:04:48.162 --> 00:04:49.872
shore up his support,

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.959
which is sagging among younger voters,

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.003
especially young black men

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.129
and young Hispanic?

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.840
That Biden's poll numbers are up.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.967
So let's not talk about sagging.

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.135
We're not talking about his skin.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:03.886
We're talking about his poll numbers.

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:05.596
So that's the first thing I'll say.

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:06.681
The second thing I'll say is

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.515
that his poll numbers are up

00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:09.225
because now we're in a general election.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:10.685
And so what we're seeing now is actually

00:05:10.685 --> 00:05:12.145
this push into a general election

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.104
where he's actually going

00:05:13.104 --> 00:05:14.647
and taking his message to the people.

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.983
And Obama and Clinton are popular,

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:18.276
unlike the GOP,

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.653
who really have no one to campaign with.

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:21.154
I mean,

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:23.323
this is a completely different party.

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.365
George W Bush

00:05:24.365 --> 00:05:25.658
has nothing to do with Trump.

00:05:25.658 --> 00:05:27.327
And let me just read a list here.

00:05:27.327 --> 00:05:30.913
Mike Pence, John Kelly, Mark Milley, John

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:31.789
Bolton, Mark Esper,

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:32.623
these were all people

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.000
who were in the Trump administration

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.836
and now disavow former President Trump.

00:05:36.836 --> 00:05:37.628
So, you know,

00:05:37.628 --> 00:05:39.672
you've got a very different kettle

00:05:39.672 --> 00:05:40.048
of fish here

00:05:40.048 --> 00:05:41.382
between Biden,

00:05:41.382 --> 00:05:42.633
who has former presidents,

00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:44.260
who he's able to sort of campaign with

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.011
and what Trump has.

00:05:45.011 --> 00:05:45.553
I was hoping

00:05:45.553 --> 00:05:47.013
w would come out of the floor

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:48.598
I was waiting for.

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.183
It was like W is showing.

00:05:50.183 --> 00:05:51.809
From the ceiling, kind of swinging.

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:53.353
Like a former president.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:54.604
I want to pick up on this question

00:05:54.604 --> 00:05:55.688
of predecessors.

00:05:55.688 --> 00:05:56.105
Yeah.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:57.065
Reporter oddly,

00:05:57.065 --> 00:06:00.651
obama was in the white house last week

00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:03.738
for several hours talking hard

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:06.115
tax campaign strategy

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:07.283
with the biden team.

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.160
How smart do you think it is

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.702
or do you think

00:06:09.702 --> 00:06:11.954
it really is going to help for biden

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:13.706
to catch up to the degree

00:06:13.706 --> 00:06:15.500
possible with obama and clinton?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:15.750
Well, look,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:17.585
I kind of agree with you in the sense

00:06:17.585 --> 00:06:19.879
that Biden's brand is still

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:20.421
I mean, I agree

00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:21.381
his poll numbers are going up,

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.466
but like his brand is still pretty weak.

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.592
Attaching yourself

00:06:24.592 --> 00:06:26.594
to more popular brands make sense

00:06:26.594 --> 00:06:28.721
and even broader than than that.

00:06:28.721 --> 00:06:29.097
I mean,

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.224
you look at the surrogates

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.850
that Trump has available to him,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.727
they basically just reinforce

00:06:34.727 --> 00:06:38.064
a narrow coalition. Biden has a

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:39.399
much broader coalition.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.525
I think the one place

00:06:40.525 --> 00:06:41.984
really one really false note

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:44.404
was they initially billed this

00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.239
going to your point about social media.

00:06:46.239 --> 00:06:47.949
Someone thought it was smart to build

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:51.327
this as a grassroots fundraiser, but

00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:53.079
this was not a grassroots.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.247
I think the top ticket was a

00:06:54.247 --> 00:06:54.831
half a million.
